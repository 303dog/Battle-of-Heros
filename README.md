# Battle-of-Heros

This is a RoR | React | JSX application.


Using a superheros API, you can select a hero and a villain to battle and see who wins.  The battle is done through an equation of attributes and the lesser obviously loses the battle.

React.js on the frontend handles the client-side. Redux middleware, Thunk handles communication ascynchronously. 

I have left some room to code an animation of some sort for the actual battle scene later when I figure that technology out.
